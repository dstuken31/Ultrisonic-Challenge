# Ultrisonic-Challenge

## Description 

A semi-realistic Dodge Challenger SRT  Demon with an ultrasonic sensor that picks up objects in its path and turns to the right in order to avoid collision.

## Picture

## Possible Solutions 

### CAD 
1) Full 3D printed shell of a car with the sides being detachable
2) Midsection of car being 3D printed, and attaching laser-cut acrylic walls to the sides

* We picked the second option. Printing the full 3D body of the car would be extremely expensive, requiring the printer to put down a large platform of material before it even started building the actual car. The second option was much more economical, with the detachable walls allowing you to pull out any of the inside components in order to fix any problems that arise.

### Code 

1) So you don't have to calculate how far you need to start turning you could have it move very slowly
2) Instead, if it is even closer you could possibly move one of the servoâ€™s slower and the other faster for a sharper turn

## Schedule

### Code

* December 6th - Finish Planning 
* December 13th - How fast the Servo's should move
* December 13th - How far away it needs to start turning
* December 18th - Fritzing Diagram Completed

### CAD 

* December 2 - Finish basic shell of the car with compeonents on the inside 
* December 3 - Finish holes for assembling the walls to the car body 
* December 6 - Finish final virtual assembly including everything
